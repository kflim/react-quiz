# Quizzical - My First React Project!

This project incorporates some basic React hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect` to create a fun little quiz.

## Challenges

- Difficulty parsing data from the Open Trivia API as there were some HTML entities in the data, which required some research in handling

- General UI structuring
